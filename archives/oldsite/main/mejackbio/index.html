 Life of Mejackmac   
</h1>
        <b style="font-weight: normal">
            Once upon a time, there was a boy named mejackmac.
            He may be weak, but he had a secret. Mejackmacjackmacker.
            Using this he scaled the corporate ladder and made his way all 
            the way to the top of the food chain. One day, as he whipped his slave
            jpbeecher, he saw an advertisement. It was for a revolutionary new
            product called the "Whip - o - Matic". He could finally whip without hand strain!
            This begun a new chapter in his mejacklife, and he was fresher than ever.
            Wise and witty, he decided to learn how to become a discord moderator, 
            and maybe some day aquire the holy nitro. Mejackmac create a server called
            "P I G" and it was a smash hit. Name stolen from "C H I C K E N", which 
            was created by his loyal slave, and recently deceased man, jpbeecher.
            He had finally become a discord moderator, and got free nitro anywhere he go,
            so what was next? Endless power, Limitless possibilities! Mejackmac decided
            it was time to go on an adventure. (REQUIRES DLC: "MEJACKMAC ADVENTURE").
            After his long adventure, mejackmac decided to do something different.
            After all, the only thing mejackmacs know nowadays is play minecraft, say n word,
            ping, whip the beecha, and use reddit. Mejackmac decided to step on the plane to china. When he got to
            china, he immediatly got the corona virus just for the sake of transferring it to
            elderly and small children. Mejackmac smiles with glee (Refer to Mejackimages), as he runs
            throughout the hospital spreading the corona virus to the elderly, and infants.
            He then proceeded to watch chungus images through zoom, with bakuthemooneater (aka super genius).
            Mejackmac slept on the flight home, listening to his queen, pokimane. Back at his
            headquarters in brazil, the jpbeechers had been keeping the place under control
            for quite a while now, but today something strange happened. One of the jpbeechers said 
            "wait a minute we are free men, why don't we just leave this place?" and then jpbeecher#2 replied
            "we are in brazil". Dreams crushed, they returned to work. However, this event still holds the record
            of most rebbellious jpbeecher. One day, at cape canaveral, there was a big launch. And not the kind
            of launch that the public can know about. Mejackmac was about to enter space. "How did this happen?"
            one may ask. Let's find out. Sunday, 8/30/2020. Mejackmac was just going through his fan mail as usual,
            when he stumbled upon something unexpected. A letter from nasa. It read "Dear Mejackmac, We are in trouble. Spacex
            is winning in nearly every way, and we need to get NASA back at number one. We recently made a discovery. There is
            alien life, but we have no way of communicating with it. They simply say "Mejackmac" over and over again. Perhaps
            if you make a flight to mars and talk to them, you can get all this straightened out. - XOXO Nasa". Mejackmac
            knew what he was going to say. And wouldn't you know, a few weeks later here he is, ready to launch. 3, 2, 1, LIFTOFF
            The speaker said, and mejackmac lost consciousness a few seconds later. Aftwe the G force went back down, mejackmac woke
            up to the view of mars.
