        <p class="entry">This is the old website that used to be hosted at <a href="https://mejackmac.com">mejackmac.com</a>. It was originally created by <a href="https://charlesispi.com">charlesispi</a> as a joke a number of years ago. The source for the website was cloned onto this site to preserve it. Many features of the site such as the forum and a good number of images unfortunatly no longer work due to dead links. The site can also be viewed at its original host at <a href="https://mejackmacdotcom.netlify.app/">this link</a>.</p>
